**Dream Catcher** is a CRUD, Model-View-Controller application using Sinatra. This app allows users to keep track of their dreams. Each dream receives a name and description and can be assigned user-created themes. Users' dream data is persisted in a SQLite3 database and accessed by Active Record Object Relational Mapping (ORM). Users are able to create new dreams, view individual dreams and a dream index, edit and delete dreams. Data on dream themes are presented to each user in a theme index. Dream interpretations are generated by scraping dreamdictionary.com for relevant dream theme data.

+ Built a CRUD, MVC app using Sinatra to create a simple content management system
+ Utilized Nokogiri to scrape an online dream dictionary for dream interpretations relevant to user submitted dreams
+ Designed database schema and managed data with SQLite and ActiveRecord
+ Applied validations and flash error messages to handle invalid user input
