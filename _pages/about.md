Howdy! I am a full stack web developer and aspiring homesteader.  I started customizing and creating WordPress themes in 2017 after leaving a career in applied gerontological research, and I have since  graduated from the Flatiron Schoolâ€™s Full Stack Web Developer Program.

With experience in Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, React, and WordPress theme development, I am seeking a **compassionate** and **supportive** team interested in using **programming** as a **force for good**.

My journey from gerontology to web development was filled with many exciting adventures, including:

Traveling in vintage Toyota motorhome
